   abstract = {A comprehensive computer program has been developed for the simulation of atomic-displacement cascades in a variety of crystalline solids, using the binary-collision approximation to contruct the projectile trajectories. The atomic scattering is governed by the Moliére potential. Impact-parameter-dependent inelastic losses are included using Firsov's theory. Thermal vibrations of the target atoms and crystal surfaces may be included. Permanent displacement of lattice atoms may be based on either an energy-threshold criterion or a Frenkel-pair-separation criterion. An extensive series of calculations has been made for cascades in the simple metals Cu, Fe, and Au, to test the effects on the results of many of the model parameters. When a displacement-threshold energy is used, the number of Frenkel pairs is found to be a linear function of that part of the primary recoil energy which remains as the kinetic energy of atoms. This result is independent of target temperature, of the presence or absence of inelastic energy losses, and of various details of the model. In contrast, when a separation criterion is used, the number of defects increases less rapidly than linearly. This effect is caused by increased recombination in the highly disturbed tracks of the energetic recoils. Agreement between theoretical and experimental estimates of the radiation damage produced by neutron irradiation of Cu is substantially improved in the latter model. © 1974 The American Physical Society.},

The influence of the interatomic potential and the inelastic energy loss model as well as the surface binding energy on the sputtering yield is investigated. Further results are sputtering yields versus incident energy and angle as well as total angular distributions of sputtered particles and energy distributions in specific solid angles for non-normal incidence.

Based on the assumption that transient phenomena are dominant in the low-energy sputtering, a modified version of Sigmund's formula is derived. The same approach is successfully applied to analysis of the angular distribution of sputtered atoms. The formula obtained is shown to predict well the heart-shaped angular distribution for normal incidence. In order to explain the non-linear effect of sputtering yields in heavy-ion bombardment on high Z material, a shock wave model is applied. The present approach has shown that the sputtering yield is nearly proportional to Sn(E)3 2, not to Sn(E), where Sn(E) is the nuclear stopping cross section. The non-linear Monte Carlo simulation is also performed in order to investigate the difference between linear cascade and non-linear cascade. © 1982.},

Surface roughness plays an important role in ion irradiation processes such as sputtering; roughness can significantly increase the angle of maximum sputtering and change the maximum observed sputtering yield by a factor of 2 or more. The complete effect of surface roughness on sputtering and other ion irradiation phenomena is not completely understood. Many rough surfaces can be consistently and realistically modeled by fractals, using the fractal dimension and fractal length scale as the sole input parameters. F-TRIDYN includes a robust fractal surface algorithm that is more computationally efficient than those in previous fractal codes and which reproduces available experimental sputtering data from rough surfaces. Fractals provide a compelling path toward a complete and concise understanding of the effect that surface geometry plays on the behavior of plasma-facing materials.

   abstract = {A quantitative simulation of ion beam sputtering and related collision cascade effects is essential for applications of ion beam irradiation in thin film deposition, surface treatment and sculpting with focused ion beams, ion beam smoothing of surfaces and ion-induced nanopattern formation. The understanding of fundamental ion-solid interaction processes relevant for nanostructure formation, ion-induced mass redistribution, sputter yield amplification, ion beam mixing and dynamic compositional changes requires reliable simulations of ion-solid interaction processes in particular at low ion energies. In this contribution we discuss the possibilities, the key benefits and the limitations of three popular binary collision Monte Carlo simulation programs (SDTrimSP, TRIDYN and SRIM). The focus will be set to the calculation of angle dependent sputter yields, angular distribution of sputtered particles, sputter yields for compound materials, sputter yield amplification effects, as well as the extraction of parameters relevant for modeling ion-induced surface pattern formation from vacancy and recoil atom distributions. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {In this manuscript we introduce a simulation tool-suite for predicting plasma-surface interactions (PSI), which aims to predict the evolution of the plasma-facing surfaces that continually change due to exposure to fusion plasmas. A comprehensive description of PSI involves a wide range of physical phenomena, of which we include components for (a) the gas implantation and its dynamic evolution below the divertor surface; (b) erosion of wall material; (c) transport and re-deposition of the eroded impurities; and (d) the scrape-off layer plasma including fuel ions and extrinsic impurities. These components are integrated to predict changes in surface morphology and fuel recycling, and the effect of material erosion and re-deposition in fuel retention. Integrated simulations for ITER-like parameters in a helium plasma environment are presented, focused on the response of the tungsten divertor. The model is also applied to predicting the response of the tungsten surface pre-damaged by He plasma, to burning plasma operations. This case further demonstrates the capability to model the effect of sub-surface helium dynamics, which include helium nucleation, clustering and the bursting of over-pressurized bubbles, its impact on fuel recycling as well as the effect of sputtering on the surface evolution.},

@article{Wittmaack2004,
   abstract = {The SRIM simulation code, developed for calculating the stopping and range of ions in matter, was evaluated with the aim of determining its reliability for predicting sputtering yields of solids and ranges of low-energy ions. The simulations were performed using two recent versions, SRIM-2000 and-2003. Irrespective of the choice of the three input parameters of the code (the surface binding, the bulk binding, and the displacement energy), the sputtering yields at a fixed impact energy were found to exhibit an unusual Z 1 dependence, which is strongly at variance with experimental results as well as with the predictions of analytical sputtering theory (Z 1 and Z 2 are the atomic numbers of projectile and target atoms, respectively). As shown in detail for targets of silicon and substantiated for titanium, the ratios of calculated to experimental or analytical yields are generally (much) too large for Z 1 / Z 2 0.7, decrease rapidly around Z 1 / Z 2 = 1, and are too small for Z 1 / Z 2 2 (high-to-low ratios differing by a factor of 3.4 at 1 keV). Additional calculations of the projectile isotope effect in sputtering suggest that the sputtering-yield artifact of SRIM is buried in an incorrect approximation to projectile-target scattering. The low-energy electronic stopping powers of SRIM-2003 were found to be much too low. Differences between detailed and quick calculation modes were also identified. Additional problems are caused by the assumed nonrandom target-atom spacing. The use of SRIM in its present form for calculating sputtering yields and low-energy ranges cannot be recommended. As a by-product of this study it was found by analysis of published experimental data as well as by simulations that, at energies below about 5 keV, the projected ranges of heavy ions in light element targets such as silicon increase with increasing projectile mass, a previously unknown effect.},

@article{Sigmund1987,
   abstract = {This article summarizes theoretical work on sputtering during the past decade, with the emphasis on elemental sputtering in the linear cascade and spike regimes as well as alloy sputtering. The sputtering of molecules and clusters, and electronic sputtering of insulators and biomolecular materials are discussed more briefly, and topics like charge and excitation states of sputtered particles as well as surface topography are left out, in view of contemporary summary papers in this issue and elsewhere. The paper is nontutorial and assumes some general knowledge of the field on the part of the reader, based e.g. on ref. [1] or ref. [2]. The discussion emphasizes principles and methods as well as open problems rather than quantitative results. A few general recommendations for efficient utilization of computer simulation conclude the paper. © 1987.},
